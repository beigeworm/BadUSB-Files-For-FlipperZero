# Ducky-Script-For-FlipperZero
This repository is a collection of scripts which have been updated specifically For the BadUSB/BadKB function on FlipperZero. 
They should however work just fine on any device that uses Ducky Script.
These scripts range from harmless pranks to nefarious red team tools. For educational purposes only! 

**These payloads are all for Windows systems**

**IMPORTANT NOTE FOR DISCORD WEBHOOKS!**

replace DISCORD_WEBHOOK_HERE with your Discord Webhook Channel and Token ONLY - eg. $dc='1206563651960586035/sNqypsq629XmXpc9TP924Dxeox6qMHDCI5e27qJ3fw4ef34wff4wf_df3aFOY'

This is because Microsoft Defender now blocks any RunPrompt commands containing `https://` or `-W Hidden` and its variations
